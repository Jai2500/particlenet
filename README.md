# ParticleNet
A simple Implementation of ParticleNet ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08570)) in Pytorch Geometric. This implementation was made in collaboration with [Animesh Sinha](https://github.com/AnimeshSinha1309) and [Kalp Shah](https://github.com/Blizzard57). 


## Requirements
1. PyTorch
2. PyTorch Geometric
3. Numpy
4. Pandas
5. Awkward Arrays
6. Uproot Methods
7. Tqdm
